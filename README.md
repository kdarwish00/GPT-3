# CSS and React.js Skills Showcase Website

This website was created to showcase my skills in CSS and React.js. It includes a variety of components and layouts that demonstrate my ability to style and structure web pages using these technologies.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- React.js

## Features

- Responsive design: The website is designed to be fully responsive and adapt to the size of the user's screen, whether it be on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device.
- Interactive components: The website features a variety of interactive components, such as buttons and form elements, that are built using React.js.
- Well-organized code: The code for the website is well-organized and easy to understand, with clear separation of concerns between the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/[USERNAME]/css-react-skills-showcase.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd css-react-skills-showcase`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`

The website should now be running on your local development server at `http://localhost:3000`. You can make changes to the code and the website will automatically reload with your updates.

## Deployment

To deploy the website to a live server, you can use a tool like [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now). Simply run the following command in the project directory:

`now`

This will build and deploy the website to a live URL that you can share with others.
